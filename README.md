# RoboJackets Constitution

The most recent revision of the RoboJackets constitution is available as [PDF](https://github.com/RoboJackets/constitution/blob/master/pub/SGA_Constitution.pdf) and autogenerated [GH Markdown](https://github.com/RoboJackets/constitution/blob/master/pub/SGA_Constitution.md). Some of the LaTeX macros can't be elaborated into Markdown, so only use that if your browser can't render PDF. 

## Setup
The LaTeX and build dependencies are about 250M. The install script intentionally does a min install that should support most command line LaTeX operations and common libraries.

`./deb_setup.sh`

## Editing
Use you favorite editor to modify the relevant file in the src/ directory.

## Building
To compile the constitution run:
`make pdf`

To compile a diff of the current tree to a previous ref, run:
`make diff <git ref>`

The ref has a default value of HEAD^ if unprovided as an argument.

## Viewing
To view the document, run:
`make view`

To view the diff, run:
`make view-diff <git ref>`


## Publishing
To publish to the repo as PDF and GH Markdown, run:
`make pub`

## Tagging
Please sign and tag releases according to the following policy:

### Draft

For example, a draft for adding an amendment might look like

`git tag -s -a draft-2017amendment.0`
